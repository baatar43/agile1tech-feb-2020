java programming - 

jdk - java core library + jre 
eclipse - intelligent editor to write program 

computer programming : providing instructions to the computer 

java, python, C# - compiler or interpreter 

java -jdk - machine language 

Programming - basic syntax - structure 

types of problems to solve 

1. monotonous 
2. big calculation 

components of problems 

1. data
2. operations or logic 


specific programming structure - java 

java - oop 

1. procedural programming - write instructions line by line and computer will execute 
2. OOP programming - you make your own design of something 

Basic Unit of Java - class 

runnable class - you can run the class - you can have some instructions to be executed line by line 
main method of java - starting point of java code - procedural programming 


non runnable class - you can not run the class 
we don't have the main method of java - oop 

eclipse - programming editor 
workspace - basically a folder 
jdk is the compiler 

when we are naming something - no space 
camel case 

package is a java folder that will store all the classes 

.java file is created - code file - every class creates a .java file 


scope - class, methods, conditonal statment {}- the limit where the code is applicable 
statments - statement ends with ; 

how to store data - number, name, 
datatype - integer, string, boolean, double, char
java case sensitive language - a A 


datatype variable = data ; 

15 
100.12
int x = 15; 

storing 15 in the variable x where x is a integer type variable 

double y = 100.12; 

Michael 

String name = "Michael";

String carplate = "34873";

declaretion + initialization; 

int x; 

x= 15; 
x=100;

int x= 15; 
String name = "Michael"; 
double y = 100.12; 
boolean test = true; 
char c = '7';

int a; 

a= 10.23;
